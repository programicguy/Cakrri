# 📌 Job Listing & Management System

## 🚀 Overview

The **Job Listing & Management System** is a dynamic web application designed to help users efficiently add, store, and search for job postings. This project leverages **vanilla JavaScript** and **localStorage** to provide a seamless and persistent job management experience.

## ✨ Features

- 📝 **Job Posting Form**: Users can add job listings with **Company Name, Job Title, Salary, and Availability**.
- ✅ **Form Validation**: Ensures required fields are filled before submission.
- 💾 **LocalStorage Integration**: Saves jobs persistently in the browser.
- 🔍 **Live Search Functionality**: Instantly filter job listings by keywords.
- 🏆 **Success Modal**: Provides confirmation upon successful job submission.
- ⚠️ **Error Handling**: Displays validation errors dynamically.
- 📋 **Job Listings**: Rendered dynamically based on stored data.
- 📱 **Responsive Navigation**: Interactive hamburger menu for easy navigation.
